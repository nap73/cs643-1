# Image Recognition pipeline in AWS using AWS Rekognition

Goal: 
The purpose of this individual assignment is to learn how to use the Amazon AWS cloud platform and how to develop an AWS application that uses existing cloud services. Specifically, you will learn: (1) how to create VMs (EC2 instances) in the cloud; (2) how to use cloud storage (S3) in your applications; (3) how to communicate between VMs using a queue service (SQS); (4) how to program distributed applications in Java on Linux VMs in the cloud; and (5) how to use a machine learning service (AWS Rekognition) in the cloud.
